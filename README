# httpd

httpd is a simple web server which only does HTTP.  This is just a research
project for tiny programs and Unix way of live.  The main idea behind this
project is, to write a daemon that just implements one protocol.

## Don'ts:
 * no IPv4 and IPv6
 * no SSL and TLS
 * no fastcgi

## Ideas:
 * UNIX Client-Server Program Interface (UCSPI)
 * protocol parsing with regex(3)
 * CGI scripts over file execution permissions
 * authentication over file others permissions and bsd-auth(3)

## expected problems
 * bad performance on large scale
 * bad latency
 * bad performance on many parallel requests

## expected improvements
 * lesser amount of source code
 * simpler source code
 * lesser maintenance
